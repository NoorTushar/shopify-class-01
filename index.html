        Hello this is <span style="color: rgb(229, 25, 25)">Noor Tushar</span>
      </h1>
      Hello, this is <strong style="font-size: 17px">Noor Tushar</strong>, an
      enthusiastic person willing to learn something new each and every day. I
      am very passionate about programming and problem-solving. I wish to become
      a successful web developer one day and also teach others how to become one
      as well. <br /><br />

      I used to be a
      <em>professional E-sports player, playing Counter-Strike,</em> and have
      won countless national titles as well as represented my country in
      <strong><em>Germany, China, and India.</em></strong> Since then, I have
      learned how to work as a team and how to lead a team. That experience has
      helped me a lot. Secondly, I love to read books. The more books I read,
      the more humble I become because then I know that I actually know nothing.
      For this reason, I have committed myself to lifelong learning because
      there is no end to it, and it will keep me humble. <br /><br />

      I have managed a full-time job, university classes, learning web
      development, and also balancing my family time. I maintained a CGPA of
      4.00 in my BBA during this period, which helped me believe that I am a
      hard worker. Without working hard and being fully committed to improving
      myself every day, I would not have managed so many things at once with
      good results. <br /><br />

      All thanks to Allah for all the blessings He has bestowed upon me. In Shaa
      Allah, one day I will be blessed by becoming a successful web developer.
